# PointExporter

PointExporter is a simple desktop application for calculating 3D curve points by specified curve segments. Each segment is defined by start point, end point, movement type formula and precision. Other settings include the radius of the curve. Based on the user defines segments and settings the application calculates the resulting 3D curve points. The points could be exported to Excel.
This functionality is useful for defining the profile and movement stages of a mechanical cam.
